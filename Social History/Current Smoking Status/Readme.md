###Comments

* This is an example of current smoking status. This example also includes a coordinating social history observation to convey the amount of smoking using a SNOMED code. This SNOMED code in the accompanying observation is not acceptable since smoking status, which is constrained by HL7 and Meaningful Use value set requirements. Each social history section shall only include a single smoking status.
